# Nem-Ajvaz

*Hello World!*

My development journey started by wanting to get a job as a Scrum Master. I passed my PSM I ([Scrum Certification])(https://www.scrum.org/certificates/568645) and started working as a psuedo Scrum Master at work. I quickly found a desire to get some more technical experience or a more intimate understanding of what a developmer goes through on a day to day basis, in order to better facilitate for my team. 

I am currently enrolled at Sydney University Web Development Bootcamp and have gained experience in HTML, CSS, Node.js and Javascript.
